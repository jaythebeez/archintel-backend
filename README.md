# ArchIntel Backend

This is my backend Implementation of the ArchIntel Project and it is written with typescript, mongoose, express and react js

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Build

Run all the typescript files and output them to the dist directory
```bash
yarn build
```
Start Local development server
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Description

This backend application is based off the REST Framework and listens to requests on the port assigned in the env variable. It is type safe thanks to type script 

## Improvements

I could have gone a step further and added documentation with openapi but due to time restrictions that is impossible
